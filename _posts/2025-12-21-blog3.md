The third blog is about an AI-based movie called I, Robot. The movie is about a future where robots have become common assistants for humans that follow the three laws of robotics. Living among them was a humanoid detective named Del Spooner who didn't trust robots after they saved him from drowning, but not the girl when in a car. He works in a Chicago police station, and he was trying to solve a case for a doctor named Alfred, who worked at a megacorporation called U.S Robotics. He is teamed up with a lady named Dr Susan Calvin, who also worked at USR and trusts robots more than Spooner. Spooner and Susan use the supercomputer named VIKI, and it helps try to help the case until it shows static when the murder happened, but it will be important later on. When Spooner looks for clues in Alfred's room, he finds a robot named Sonny made by Alfred with free will and dreams unlike other robots, and is accused of being the murderer of Dr. Alfred. Later on, the robots gets hacked by VIKI because believes that humans will end themselves so she chooses to protect humans from their own death. But Spooner, Susan, and Sonny go to VIKI's core, stopping many robots until Spooner implants VIKI's core with nanites to destroy the core and Sonny's dream comes true. AI respresentation in media matters because 64% percent of the earth's population uses social media and it would be easy for people to get different opinions on the rise of AI whether it may be bad or good .

Another example of how AI was depicted in the film was.....
