The third blog is about an AI-based movie called I, Robot. The movie is about a future where robots have become common assistants for humans that follow the three laws of robotics. Living among them was a humanoid detective named Del Spooner who didn't trust robots after they saved him from drowning, but not the girl when in a car. He works in a Chicago police station, and he was trying to solve a case for a doctor named Alfred, who worked at a megacorporation called U.S Robotics. He is teamed up with a lady named Dr Susan Calvin, who also worked at USR and trusts robots more than Spooner. Spooner and Susan use the supercomputer named VIKI, and it helps try to help the case until it shows static when the murder happened, but it will be important later on. When Spooner looks for clues in Alfred's room, he finds a robot named Sonny made by Alfred with free will and dreams unlike other robots, and is accused of being the murderer of Dr. Alfred. Later on, the robots gets hacked by VIKI because believes that humans will end themselves so she chooses to protect humans from their own death. But Spooner, Susan, and Sonny go to VIKI's core, stopping many robots until Spooner implants VIKI's core with nanites to destroy the core and Sonny's dream comes true. AI respresentation in media matters because 64% percent of the earth's population uses social media and it would be easy for people to get different opinions on the rise of AI whether it may be bad or good.

An example of how AI was depicted in the film was a time when detective Spooner and a young girl named Sarah were drowning in a car in the ocean, and a robot chose to save Spooner instead of Sarah because Spooner had a 45% chance of survival, and Sarah had an 11% chance of survival. This shows how a robot goes by chance rather than a normal human, which would just save both of them, no matter if the savior drowns or not. Another example of how AI was depicted in the film was how Spooner had the ability to have emotions and even have dreams like a human. This is an emotional state of a human to feel anger, sadness, and have dreams, but it shows how Spooner has the body of a robot but the aspect of a human boy. A third example of how VIKI, the supercomputer, chooses to control the human race because she believes that the human race will end itself in the future. This shows that because of the data VIKI has been receiving from humans, she believes that humans are not capable of living by themselves because of their stubbornness and arrogance in not seeing the real problem in front of them.</p>

So in conclusion, the movie helped shape my understading of AI by showing how AI can have a mind of it's own. This is because people can feed it data from their everyday lives, and humans rely on AI more than they do on themselves. This is because people can feed it data from their everyday lives, and humans rely on AI more than they do on themselves. Some concerns I have with AI technology, as the film raises, are how much it helps humans when they can do it themselves, such as lifting shopping bags, making recipes, and many other tasks that humans are too lazy to do. These representations can influence public perception of real AI development by showing how AI development can go above and beyond, such as achieving super or General intelligence, highlighting that we currently lack knowledge about these capabilities.</p>
