What I did this summer was spend more time with my family because I wouldn't have, as I had schoolwork to do. I did things like bowling, searching for internships, and even read a book over the summer. But the one main thing I did do was think about what I was going to do after school because I was in the Steam center, which gives me opportunities that you would usually get in college, so I was a few years ahead of my time. But I was worried that I might not be ready for the future because I have to go to college, get an internship, get a career, and more things I don't feel like I am ready for. So I had a talk with my mother about what my future holds, and she told me that I control my future, and you should just move along with the future and not hold back. I kept that with me now and for my future, so I can not be scared of what's next and be more confident.
