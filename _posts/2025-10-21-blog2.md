Now you might look at this code and wonder what is he doing. Well all of this code is called debugging. Debugging is going through your code and fixing any mistakes that might stop your code. You can use run and debug to see the errors of the code and how to fix it. Allow me to walk you though 4 excercises where you can use debugging
```
1.
text = "Hello, world, my name is"
count = 0

for char in text:
    if char == "":
       count += 1

print(count)
```
```

"Exercise 1"

text = "Hello, world, my name is"
count = 0

for char in text:
    if char == " ":#add a space to char for the code to work
       count += 1

print(count)

2.
print("give me a number")
n = input()

for num in range(1, n):
    if num % 2 < 0:
        print(num, "is even.")
    else:
        print(num, "is odd.")

```
```
"Exercise 2"
n = int(input("give me a number: "))

for num in range(1, n):
    if num % 2 == 0:#make the less than sign into ==
        print(num, "is even.")
    else:
        print(num, "is odd.")

3.
num = int(input("Enter an integer: "))

if num < -1:
  print("No negative numbers.")
else:
  result = 1
  for i in range(1, num):
    result *= i   

  print("Factorial of " + num + "is" + result)
```
```

"Exercise 3"
num = int(input("Enter an integer: "))

if num < 0:#change -1 into 0
  print("No negative numbers.")
else:
  result = 1
  for i in range(1, num):
    result *= i   

  print("Factorial of " + str(num) + " is " +  str(result))

4.
attempts = 0
correct_password = "secret"

while True:
    password = input("Enter your password: ")
    attempts += 1

    if password == "incorrect_password":
        print("Correct password!")
    else:
        print("Incorrect password")

    if attempts > 3:
        print("Too many attempts")
        break





```
```
"Exercise 4"

attempts = 0
correct_password = "secret"

while True:
    password = input("Enter your password: ")
    attempts += 1

    if password == correct_password:#change incorrect password into correct passsword
        print("Correct password!")
        break
    else:
        print("Incorrect password")

    if attempts >= 3:#create greater than or equal sign
        print("Too many attempts")
        break
```
