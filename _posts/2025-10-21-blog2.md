Now you might look at this code and wonder what is he doing. Well all of this code is called debugging. Debugging is going through your code and fixing any mistakes that might stop your code. You can use run and debug to see the errors of the code and how to fix it. Allow me to walk you though 4 excercises where you can use debugging

```
Before
1.
text = "Hello, world, my name is"
count = 0

for char in text:
    if char == "":
       count += 1

print(count)
```
For the first one the char "" has no space meaning that there is no value in the quotaion marks. If there is no value in the quotation marks then that would give you an error. A way to fix this error is by adding a space in the quotation marks so there can be a value and the numbers can count up with no errors
```
After
"Exercise 1"

text = "Hello, world, my name is"
count = 0

for char in text:
    if char == " ":#add a space to char for the code to work
       count += 1

print(count)
```
<img src="/blog/images/2.jpeg" alt="Picture of 2 on fire">

```
Before
2.
print("give me a number")
n = input()

for num in range(1, n):
    if num % 2 < 0:
        print(num, "is even.")
    else:
        print(num, "is odd.")

```
In the second exercise there are two errors shown in the before code. One error is the print statement asking to give a number but if we give it a number it will give us a error because the number is a string. A way to fix this is to make the print statement into a input then outside the input would be an int with parenteses so you can put any integer as long as it is a whole number
```
After
"Exercise 2"
n = int(input("give me a number: "))

for num in range(1, n):
    if num % 2 == 0:#make the less than sign into ==
        print(num, "is even.")
    else:
        print(num, "is odd.")


```
<img src="/blog/images/3.jpeg" alt="Picture of 3 on fire">

```
Before
3.
num = int(input("Enter an integer: "))

if num < -1:
  print("No negative numbers.")
else:
  result = 1
  for i in range(1, num):
    result *= i   

  print("Factorial of " + num + "is" + result)
```
In the third exercise there are also multiple errors within this code
```
After
"Exercise 3"
num = int(input("Enter an integer: "))

if num < 0:#change -1 into 0
  print("No negative numbers.")
else:
  result = 1
  for i in range(1, num):
    result *= i   

  print("Factorial of " + str(num) + " is " +  str(result))


```
<img src="/blog/images/4.jpeg" alt="Picture of 4 on fire">

```
Before
4.
attempts = 0
correct_password = "secret"

while True:
    password = input("Enter your password: ")
    attempts += 1

    if password == "incorrect_password":
        print("Correct password!")
    else:
        print("Incorrect password")

    if attempts > 3:
        print("Too many attempts")
        break





```
```
After
"Exercise 4"

attempts = 0
correct_password = "secret"

while True:
    password = input("Enter your password: ")
    attempts += 1

    if password == correct_password:#change incorrect password into correct passsword
        print("Correct password!")
        break
    else:
        print("Incorrect password")

    if attempts >= 3:#create greater than or equal sign
        print("Too many attempts")
        break
```
