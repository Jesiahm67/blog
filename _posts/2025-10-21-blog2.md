Now you might look at this code and wonder what is he doing. Well all of this code is called debugging. Debugging is going through your code and fixing any mistakes that might stop your code. You can use run and debug to see the errors of the code and how to fix it. Allow me to walk you though 4 excercises where you can use debugging

```
Before
1.
text = "Hello, world, my name is"
count = 0

for char in text:
    if char == "":
       count += 1

print(count)
```
For the first excercise the char "" has no space, meaning that there is no value in the quotaion marks. If there is no value in the quotation marks, then it won't give you an error, but it will not count the spaces in the sentence. A way to fix this error is by adding a space between the quotation marks, so there can be a value, and the numbers can count up with no errors. This would not be an error because in python a space is considered a value, just like if you put a letter or a number. Also, putting a space means it counts how many spaces are in the string above. So if you put a letter that came from the string in the quotation marks, it can count how much of that value is in the string.

```
After
"Exercise 1"

text = "Hello, world, my name is"
count = 0

for char in text:
    if char == " ":#add a space to char for the code to work
       count += 1

print(count)
```

```
Before
2.
print("give me a number")
n = input()

for num in range(1, n):
    if num % 2 < 0:
        print(num, "is even.")
    else:
        print(num, "is odd.")

```
In the second exercise, there are two errors shown in the code before. One error is the print statement asking to give a number, but if we give it a number, it will give us a TypeError because the number is a string, and the for loop below can only take an integer, a float(decimal), or even a complex number, which is a number after a letter. A way to fix this is to turn the print statement into an input, then outside the input, put in an int so you can put any value as long as it is a whole number. The second mistake is the if statement having a less-than sign. A way to fix this error is to have two equal signs because the two equal signs mean comparing two values in if or elif statements. Having one equal sign means making a value for a variable, like having a number = 8, and you can use on later.
```
After
"Exercise 2"
n = int(input("give me a number: "))

for num in range(1, n):
    if num % 2 == 0:#make the less than sign into ==
        print(num, "is even.")
    else:
        print(num, "is odd.")


```
<img src="/blog/images/3.jpeg" alt="Picture of 3 on fire">

```
Before
3.
num = int(input("Enter an integer: "))

if num < -1:
  print("No negative numbers.")
else:
  result = 1
  for i in range(1, num):
    result *= i   

  print("Factorial of " + num + "is" + result)
```
In the third exercise there are also multiple errors within this code and we will go through this one together because personally I had trouble with this one. So the first mistake there is that the if statement is num < -1 because if the number is 0 then it will pass as a statement and we don't want that. So a way to fix this is to replace -1 into  0 so any number less than 0 will result as negative and the print statement would be used in the if statement. The second mistake is a hard one to spot but as you see in the print statement, to the untrained eyeball it looks like it would run smoothly but it will give you a typeerror. It is because the variables in the print are not strings and the way to fix it is to make the variables into strings as shown below. The reason they must be strings because you can't have multiple data types in the print statement because without the data change that will give you a error.
```
After
"Exercise 3"
num = int(input("Enter an integer: "))

if num < 0:#change -1 into 0
  print("No negative numbers.")
else:
  result = 1
  for i in range(1, num):
    result *= i   

  print("Factorial of " + str(num) + " is " +  str(result))


```
<img src="/blog/images/4.jpeg" alt="Picture of 4 on fire">

```
Before
4.
attempts = 0
correct_password = "secret"

while True:
    password = input("Enter your password: ")
    attempts += 1

    if password == "incorrect_password":
        print("Correct password!")
    else:
        print("Incorrect password")

    if attempts > 3:
        print("Too many attempts")
        break



```
The final exercise contains two errors in the code that we will review together. The first error is in the if statement, where the password is being compared to the incorrect password. If we run the code for the first error, it will display the print statement 'Incorrect Password'. The reason is that the incorrect password is a string, so the code will run until we type incorrect_password. We can fix this by changing the incorrect password to the correct password above, making the variable useful. The second error is the number of attempts we are given. If we run the code, you will get four attempts, whereas we aim for three attempts. A way to fix this error is to use a greater than or equal to sign, so 3 will be the maximum number of attempts.
```
After
"Exercise 4"

attempts = 0
correct_password = "secret"

while True:
    password = input("Enter your password: ")
    attempts += 1

    if password == correct_password:#change incorrect password into correct passsword
        print("Correct password!")
        break
    else:
        print("Incorrect password")

    if attempts >= 3:#create greater than or equal sign
        print("Too many attempts")
        break
```
So now you know how to handle challenges like these when they come you way in the future. but if you ever get stumbles you can use the left taskbar and you can see a play button with a bug, click it and you will find run and debug click on it if you can't find the error using the termimal. And even though some of these challenges were hard for me and maybe for you, there is nothing stopping you from learning more and doing trial and error until you get the right answer. So I hoped you had a great lesson in learning exercises and I wish you a good future for learning and for fun.
